  		<p class="content">Paneer is a fresh cheese that is very common in Indian cuisine. I never cooked with it until last year, when I made a fried paneer recipe from Madhur Jaffrey’s Vegetarian India. Part of the battle is finding a store that carries paneer in the first place. </p>

   		<p class="content">A dosa is a rice pancake, originating from South India, made from a fermented batter. It is somewhat similar to a crepe in appearance. Its main ingredients are rice and black gram, ground together in a fine, smooth batter with a dash of salt. Dosas are a common part of the diet in South India, but have become popular all over the Indian subcontinent. Traditionally, dosas are served hot along with sambar and chutney.</p>
